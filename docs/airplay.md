# Shairport-Sync for AirPlay

>Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player â€“ it plays audio streamed from iTunes, iOS, Apple TV and macOS devices and AirPlay sources such as Quicktime Player and ForkedDaapd, among others.
Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. In this way, synchronised multi-room audio is possible for players that support it, such as iTunes.

## Install
```shell
sudo apt install shairport-sync
```

This will install shairport-sync and start the systemd service `shairport-sync.service`.

## Configure
The configuration file is `/etc/shairport-sync.conf`.
